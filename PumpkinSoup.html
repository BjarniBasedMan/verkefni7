<p><strong>Sonic Adventure 2 var fyrsti Sonic leikurinn sem Tomoya samdi fyrir. Þá var hann undir leiðsögn Jun Senoues.
<br>Tomoya samdi mjög fá lög fyrir þennan leik en hann sá um að semja nokkur rapp-lög sem voru flutt af bandaríkjamanninum Hunnid P.</strong></p>

<h2>Hvað er í gangi í leiknum?</h2>
Í Sonic Adventure 2 er hægt að spila sem fleiri persónur en bara Sonic. 
Þetta lag fjallar í rauninni alls ekki um Sonic heldur um Knuckles the Echidna, einn af vinum Sonic's. <br>
Knuckles er harður gaur, alvarlegur og aðeins meiri intróvert en Sonic. Hann getur klifrað upp veggi, svifið í loftinu og barið óvini með risastóru hnúunum sínum (hann heitir Knuckles eftir allt).<br>
Knuckles hefur það hlutverk að verja risastórann smaragð sem heitir The Master Emerald. Smaragðurinn býr yfir miklum krafti, en síðan brotnar hann í marga litla bita. Knuckles verður að leyta að bitunum og koma í veg fyrir að þeir falli í röngu hendurnar.<br>
Í þessu lagi er Knuckles staddur í Pumpkin Hill, sem er mjög hrekkjavökulegur staður. Lagið er sagt frá sjónarhorni Knuckles og veitir innsýn í hugsanir og tilfinningar hans á meðan hann fer í gegnum borðið.<br>

<h2>Texti</h2>

You know me, the fighting freak Knuckles,<br>
And we're at Pumpkin Hill,<br>
You ready?<br>
I ain't gonna let it get to me, I'm just gonna creep,<br>
Down in Pumpkin Hill I gots to find my lost piece.<br>
I know that it's here, I can sense it in my feet,<br>
The great Emerald's power allows me to feel.<br>
I can't see a thing but it's around somewhere,<br>
I'm gonna hold my head 'cause I have no fear.<br>
This probably seems crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory,<br>
A ghost tried to approach me and got leery.<br>
Asked him a question and he vanished in a second,<br>
I'm walkin' through valleys cryin' pumpkin in the alley.<br>
Didn't seem happy but they sure tried to get me,<br>
Had to back 'em up with the fist, metal crack 'em.<br>
I'm hearing someone sayin' "You a chicken, don't be scared!"<br>
It had to be the wind, 'cause nobody wasn't there.<br>
I searched and I searched as I climbed up the wall,<br>
And then I started to fly, I went in deeper!<br>
Let it get to me? I'm just gonna creep,<br>
Down in Pumpkin Hill I gots to find my lost piece.<br>
I know that it's here, I sense it in my feet,<br>
The great Emerald's power allows me to feel.<br>
I can't see a thing but it's around somewhere,<br>
I gotta hold my head, I have no fear.<br>
It probably seems crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory,<br>
A ghost tried to approach me, he got leery.<br>
(This is Knuckles, who fears none.)<br>
(It's real deal when it comes to my name, kid!)<br>

(Spooky up in here, it's crazy in here,)<br>
(We still gon' keep it goin', I'm Knuckles.)<br>
(Nobody scares me,)<br>
(Whoever want it, bring it!)<br>
(I don't care, we 'ka do this.)<br>
(Then come step up to the plate, and meet your match,)<br>
(It ain't no thang.)<br>
